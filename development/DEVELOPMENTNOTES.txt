Rock, Paper, Scissors Machine Learning Notes.

.train(trainingData) -> pattern recognition 

.run(input) -> outputs a prediction

STAGE 1 (Maybe not really necessary, except for illustrating how it works, could just be single stage with pre-constructed trainingData):

* user builds initial training data by correctly defining the rules of rock paper scissors
* trainingData is structured ->
  [
    { input: [1,2], output: 2 },
    { input: [1,3], output: 1 },
    { input: [2,3], output: 3 }
  ]

  rock = 1
  paper = 2
  scissors = 3

  input array represents a match, ie [1,2] represents rock vs paper.
  output represents the winner, ie 2 represents rock beats paper.


STAGE 2:

each round will consist of:

* user will be able to click 1 of 3 buttons -> rock (value: 1), paper (value: 2), or scissors (value: 3) -> value is stored in [0] of an input array.
* neuralnet.run() will make a prediction for the AI -> rock (value: 1), paper (value: 2), or scissors (value: 3) -> value is stored in [1] of an input array.

* round winner is determined -> score adjusted accordingly.
* match results are saved, formatted into trainingData.
* neuralnet is retrained.
* repeat until AI reaches a specified win percentage.
